## _LEGO® Universe Multiplayer Emulator in Node_

This is an emulator written in TypeScript/Node for the discontinued game LEGO® Universe.

## Note

This is a work in progress emulator, and it should be noted that progress will likely be slow. If I'm not having fun, I'm not gonna work on it, plain and simple.

I'm using this as a learning experience to get better at TypeScript and Node in general.

Also, for those who might be unfamiliar with who I am. Hi, I'm Elena, better known in the LEGO® Universe community as Tracer. I've previously worked on JALUS and briefly on Uchu.
